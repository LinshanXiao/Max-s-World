# UWA Agile Web 2024 Demo Project
This Project is a movie discussion forum. The aiming of this application are : 
1. People who love movies are allowed to share their thoughts, understanding or even in depth that is the art of the film. 
2. Avoiding terrible movies. For instance, you are plan to watch a movie at cinema, you can read other people's reviews and decide which movie to watch in case watching boring movies and fall asleep at the cinema. 
3. Handling your sharing desire. It must appears to everyone that after you watch a awesome or awful movie, you want to share. Your friends might not watched the movies you watched, but some people use the applation must have watched that movie. 

Here are the steps we used to constructe our application.
1. User Authentication and Registration. We first need to create a page that allows user to create accounts and login their existing accounts. Users can only share their reviews and rating by signning in the app. 
2. Database integration. Integrate movie database which includes every information about the movies. Create a database that keeps user's profile information and create a database that saves users posts and other history. 
3. Discussion Threads: Implement a system where users can create and participate in discussion threads for different movies. Each thread should allow users to leave comments, ask questions, and engage with other users.
Rating and Review System: Allow users to rate movies and leave reviews. You can implement a star rating system or a numerical rating system, along with optional text reviews.
4. Search and Filtering: Provide search functionality so users can easily find movies and discussion threads. You can also implement filtering options based on genres, release years, ratings, etc.
5. User Profiles: Create user profiles where users can view their activity, such as the discussions they've participated in, the movies they've rated, and their overall contribution to the site.
6. Notifications: Implement a notification system to alert users about new replies to their comments or discussions they're following.
7. Moderation Tools: Implement tools for moderators to manage user-generated content, such as deleting inappropriate comments or banning users who violate community guidelines.
8. Responsive Design: Ensure your website is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
9. Community Guidelines and Policies: Clearly communicate community guidelines and policies to ensure a respectful and welcoming environment for all users.
10. Feedback Mechanism: Provide a way for users to give feedback and suggestions for improving the website. This could be through a contact form or a dedicated feedback forum.
